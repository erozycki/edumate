    <h2>First steps</h2>
    <p>Try reading the <a href="{% url 'sr:why-edumate' %}">overview</a> to get a basic understanding of what Edumate does, or jump right in by
        <a href="{% url 'sr:register' %}">creating an account!</a></p>
    <h2>How to use Edumate</h2>
    <p>Once you have an account, subscribe to one or more decks on the <a href="{% url 'sr:browse-decks' %}">browse decks page</a>. Decks are composed of
       flashcards, which are scheduled for review by Edumate. You can view your decks, see what is due, and initiate review sessions on the
       <a href="{% url 'sr:decks' %}">my decks page</a>.
    <p>Each card consists of a prompt and an answer. The prompt is presented first - try to answer it as best as you can, and then press any key
       to reveal the answer.
       Afterward, indicate your performance: press "Wrong" if you got the item wrong, "Right" if you got it right, and "Trivial" if the item was so easy
       that you don't think you'll need to review it very often.</p>
    <p>Under construction...</p>
